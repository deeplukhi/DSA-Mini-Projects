## ✈️ Flight Management System

An efficient **Flight Route Planner** built in C++. This project uses graph algorithms like **Dijkstra** or **A\*** to find the **shortest and fastest** flight paths between airports.

- Built using adjacency lists and priority queues
- Handles thousands of routes efficiently
- Uses input from `flights.txt`
- Good example of real-world graph application

## 🚀 Maze Solver

This program finds the shortest path through a **10x10 maze** using **BFS/DFS or A\*** algorithms.

- Avoids obstacles
- Shows valid path from start to destination
- Can be easily extended to larger mazes
- Great for visualizing pathfinding

## 🎯 Sudoku Solver

A clean and functional **9x9 Sudoku Solver** using **Backtracking Algorithm** in C++.

- Efficient recursive algorithm
- Validates placement of digits
- Solves any standard puzzle in milliseconds
- Includes `.exe` for instant use
